[Solution to Weaviate's Machine Learning Engineer Challenge.](https://weaviate.notion.site/Machine-Learning-Engineer-Challenge-f3bc639b111a43f0b72d186454b2d288). This solution addresses challenges 1 and 2.2 from the Notion.

We will explore the [LinkedIn job postings (2023-2024) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/) from Kaggle. The purpose of this project is to cluster job postings in the machine learning field. We will engineer useful data fields, add them to a Weaviate collection using Cohere embedding, and extract the job postings related to machine learning using semantic search.

The workflow.ipynb notebook 

Requires the postings.csv file from Kaggle to be in the directory.
